Hello! As a coding test, I was once asked to write a batch processor for XML data. Provided with a large array of photographs and their metadata, my program would automatically generate an HTML page with thumbnails of the photos. Separate pages would display thumbnails sorted by camera brands and by the models those companies produce. This is the result! 

The original prompt file contains the design specs I was given.
The introduction file contains an instructions guide and my notes on the project.

All in all, Iâ€™m very proud of how this project turned out. I hope you like it too!
